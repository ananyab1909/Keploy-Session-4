  1. AI-powered API test generation using Keploy to auto-capture and replay real HTTP interactions
  2. Auto-generated test suites with support for both positive and negative test cases
  3. Achieved 83%+ test coverage in minutes using recorded scenarios
  4. End-to-end testing across all CRUD operations: CreateUser, GetUsers, UpdateUser, DeleteUser
  5. Seamless integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automated test execution
  6. Supports API test recording via the Keploy Chrome Extension
